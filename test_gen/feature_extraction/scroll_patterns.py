"""
Scroll-Pattern Detection for rrweb Session Feature Extraction.

This module provides functionality to detect scroll events that trigger DOM mutations
within a specified time window. This is useful for identifying lazy loading behaviors,
infinite scroll implementations, and other scroll-triggered content updates.

The detection algorithm pairs each scroll event with the next DOM mutation that occurs
within the maximum reaction time window. This helps identify responsive UI behaviors
where scrolling triggers content changes, such as:
- Lazy loading of images or content
- Infinite scroll pagination
- Dynamic content updates based on viewport position
- Progressive disclosure patterns

Configuration:
    Uses DEFAULT_SCROLL_REACTION_MS from config module.
    All parameters can be overridden via function arguments.

Usage:
    from .config import DEFAULT_SCROLL_REACTION_MS
    patterns = detect_scroll_patterns(events)
    for pattern in patterns:
        print(f"Scroll at {pattern.scroll_event['timestamp']} triggered mutation after {pattern.delay_ms}ms")

    Identifies scroll events followed by DOM mutations within a time window.

    This function processes rrweb events to find scroll events (type == 3, data.source == 3)
    that are followed by DOM mutation events (type == 3, data.source == 0) within a
    specified time window. This is useful for detecting scroll-triggered behaviors like
    lazy loading, infinite scroll, and dynamic content updates.

    Args:
        events: List of rrweb events to analyze

    Returns:
        List of ScrollPattern objects representing scrollâ†’mutation pairs, ordered
        chronologically by scroll event timestamp. Each pattern contains:
        - scroll_event: The original scroll event data
        - mutation_event: The DOM mutation that followed the scroll
        - delay_ms: Time between scroll and mutation in milliseconds

    Note:
        Each scroll event matches at most one mutation event (the first one within
        the time window). After a match is found, the search continues from the
        next scroll event. Events that are not scroll or mutation events are ignored.
