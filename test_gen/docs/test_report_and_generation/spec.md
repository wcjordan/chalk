### ðŸ“„ **Summary of Conversation: Requirements Document + Project Plan**

---

### **Project Goal**

Build a Python-based modular CLI tool to analyze rrweb web app session data, generalize it into user workflows and actions, and generate a minimal, efficient set of Playwright Python tests covering the appâ€™s core functionality.

The system should:
âœ… Use LLM + rule-based analysis
âœ… Incorporate human-in-the-loop review and correction
âœ… Generate clear, maintainable test code
âœ… Learn and improve from past feedback
âœ… Produce traceable mappings and metadata

---

### **Core Requirements**

âœ… **Inputs**

* Combined, per-session rrweb JSON files (provided locally)
* Existing annotated mappings (stored in flat files)

âœ… **Outputs**

* Playwright Python test scripts (written directly into the `tests/` folder)
* Helper modules abstracting common user actions
* Metadata files mapping workflows, actions, confidence, and session origins
* Combined human-readable report file (YAML, JSON, or markdown) listing analyzed mappings, confidence scores, and unknowns

âœ… **Workflow**

1. Analyze session data using LLM + rule-based matching (bootstrap initial rules)
2. Generate proposed mappings and confidence levels
3. Output combined review report for human annotation
4. Incorporate feedback into the knowledge base (stored in flat files)
5. Generate Playwright tests with plain-English descriptions and modular helpers
6. Write tests directly into the repoâ€™s `tests/` folder
7. Allow reruns on-demand via CLI commands

âœ… **System Design**

* Modular Python CLI package with subcommands (`analyze`, `report`, `generate`)
* LLM-agnostic interface (initially cloud APIâ€“based)
* Learning system to improve mappings over time
* Flat fileâ€“based feedback and knowledge storage, designed for future upgrade to a database
* Out of scope: session data fetching, CI integration, automated failure analysis, or formatting enforcement

### **Initial CLI Commands**

| Command    | Description                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `analyze`  | Run LLM + rule-based analysis on session files, update mappings      |
| `report`   | Generate combined review file summarizing mappings + confidence      |
| `generate` | Produce Playwright test scripts, helpers, and metadata into `tests/` |

### **Implementation Phases**

âœ… **Phase 1** â€” Foundations

* Build CLI scaffolding + subcommands
* Write LLM integration + rule bootstrap logic
* Create initial flat file structures for mappings + feedback

âœ… **Phase 2** â€” Analysis + Reporting

* Implement session analyzer
* Generate combined human-readable report (flag low-confidence areas)
* Allow manual edits/annotations to mappings

âœ… **Phase 3** â€” Test Generation

* Develop test + helper code generators
* Embed plain-English descriptions
* Write directly into the `tests/` folder

âœ… **Phase 4** â€” Learning System

* Update mappings + rules from feedback files
* Improve LLM context feeding

âœ… **Phase 5 (Future)** â€” Enhancements

* Add web dashboard interface
* Migrate learning store to local DB
* Add automated selector change detection or failure analysis
