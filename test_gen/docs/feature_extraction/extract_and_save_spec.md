⏺ Based on my analysis of the documentation and existing code, I can see that:

  1. The rule engine's process_chunk_file function loads chunk JSON files for rule matching
  2. The feature extraction pipeline already exists with functions to extract features from chunks
  3. There's a test_full_pipeline_integration function that processes sessions but doesn't save the extracted features
  4. The test_gen/data/output_features directory exists but is empty

  Now I'll create a comprehensive plan for adding feature extraction output functionality to the pipeline.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze existing feature extraction pipeline and test functions
     ☐ Design function signature and interface for extract_and_save_features
     ☐ Implement extract_and_save_features function in pipeline.py
     ☐ Add JSON serialization support for FeatureChunk and nested models
     ☐ Create output directory structure and file naming convention
     ☐ Add comprehensive error handling and validation
     ☐ Write unit tests for the new functionality
     ☐ Create integration test similar to test_full_pipeline_integration
     ☐ Add CLI interface for batch processing sessions to features
     ☐ Document the new functionality and usage examples

⏺ Based on my analysis of the existing codebase, here's a comprehensive plan for adding feature extraction output functionality to test_gen/feature_extraction/pipeline.py:

  Plan: Add Feature Extraction Output to Pipeline

  Overview

  The goal is to create a function similar to test_full_pipeline_integration that extracts features from session files and saves them as JSON files to test_gen/data/output_features. This will enable the
  rule engine's process_chunk_file function to load these pre-extracted features instead of raw chunks.

  Key Components

  1. Function Design
  - Create extract_and_save_features(session_dir, output_dir, max_sessions=None)
  - Similar interface to iterate_feature_extraction but saves results to disk
  - Process sessions from test_gen/data/output_sessions
  - Save to test_gen/data/output_features

  2. JSON Serialization
  - Add to_dict() methods to FeatureChunk and all nested models
  - Handle dataclass serialization for DOM mutations, interactions, delays, etc.
  - Ensure output JSON is compatible with rule engine input expectations

  3. File Organization
  - Mirror the session file structure: {session_id}_{chunk_id}.json
  - Include metadata about feature extraction process
  - Maintain consistency with existing chunk file format

  4. Error Handling
  - Graceful handling of sessions with missing DOM snapshots
  - Recovery from individual chunk processing failures
  - Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

  5. Integration Testing
  - Test end-to-end: session → feature extraction → rule matching
  - Validate JSON serialization/deserialization roundtrip
  - Performance testing with large session volumes

  6. CLI Interface
  - Command-line tool for batch processing sessions
  - Progress reporting and statistics
  - Configurable output directories and session limits

  Implementation Steps

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Analyze existing feature extraction pipeline and test functions
     ☐ Design function signature and interface for extract_and_save_features
     ☐ Implement extract_and_save_features function in pipeline.py
     ☐ Add JSON serialization support for FeatureChunk and nested models
     ☐ Create output directory structure and file naming convention

     ☐ Create integration test similar to test_full_pipeline_integration
     ☐ Add CLI interface for batch processing sessions to features
     ☐ Document the new functionality and usage examples

⏺ 1. Analyze existing pipeline ✅ - Understand current iterate_feature_extraction and test_full_pipeline_integration
  2. Design function interface - Define extract_and_save_features() with clear parameters and return values
  3. Add JSON serialization - Implement to_dict() methods for all dataclass models to enable JSON export
  4. Implement core function - Create the main extraction and saving logic
  5. File organization - Design output directory structure and naming conventions
  6. Error handling - Add robust error recovery for production use
  7. Testing - Unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability
  8. CLI interface - Command-line tool for batch processing
  9. Documentation - Usage examples and API documentation

  Expected Benefits

  - Rule engine integration: Pre-extracted features can be loaded directly by process_chunk_file
  - Performance: Avoid re-extracting features for multiple rule runs
  - Debugging: Inspect extracted features in human-readable JSON format
  - Scalability: Batch process large numbers of sessions efficiently
  - Consistency: Standardized feature extraction across different use cases

  This approach follows the existing patterns in the codebase while adding the missing piece needed to bridge feature extraction with rule-based action matching.
