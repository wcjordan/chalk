### **Step 1: List and Download JSON Files from GCS**

**What it accomplishes:**
Adds the ability to connect to a specified GCS bucket, list all JSON files in a flat structure, and download them to memory or a temporary local path.

**How to verify:**

* Run the script with a test bucket.
* Confirm the correct number of files are retrieved.
* Print or log a list of filenames or file sizes.
* Include unit tests for GCS interaction using mocks.

**Detailed Prompt**

You are writing the first part of a Python script that processes session JSON files stored in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.

#### 🛠️ Task

Implement a function that does the following:

* Connects to a specified GCS bucket.
* Lists all `.json` files in the root (flat structure, no subdirectories).
* Downloads the contents of each file into memory (as bytes or strings).
* Returns a list of `(filename, file_content)` pairs.

You should:

* Use the `google-cloud-storage` Python library.
* Handle authentication using Application Default Credentials (ADC).
* Include basic error handling and logging (e.g., if a file can't be read).
* Add a main function that demonstrates downloading files from a bucket called `example-bucket`.

#### 🧪 Verification

When run, the script should:

* Print the number of `.json` files found.
* Print the first 100 characters of the first file’s content (as a sanity check).

Do **not** implement any session grouping or JSON parsing yet — this step is only about listing and retrieving the raw files.

---

### **Step 2: Parse and Validate a Single JSON File**

**What it accomplishes:**
Implements logic to read a file and validate that it contains the expected fields (`session_guid`, `session_data`, `environment`). Handles malformed or incomplete files gracefully.

**How to verify:**

* Create test files: valid JSON, missing fields, corrupt format.
* Run parsing function on each and confirm correct error handling.
* Confirm logging or exception capture works as expected.
* Include unit tests for edge cases.

**Detailed Prompt**

You are continuing work on a Python script that processes session JSON files downloaded from GCS. Each file is expected to contain session information captured by `rrweb`.

#### 🛠️ Task

Implement a function called `parse_and_validate_session_file` that takes a single argument:

```python
def parse_and_validate_session_file(filename: str, content: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
```

The function should:

* Attempt to parse the `content` (a string containing JSON).
* Validate that the parsed object is a dictionary and contains the following fields:

  * `"session_guid"` (non-empty string)
  * `"session_data"` (a list)
  * `"environment"` (string)
* If the file is valid:

  * Return a dictionary with keys: `filename`, `session_guid`, `session_data`, `environment`.
* If the file is invalid or malformed:

  * Log a warning using Python's `logging` module, including the filename and reason.
  * Return `None`.

#### 🧪 Verification

Create a short test suite or inline test cases to demonstrate the following:

* A valid JSON input returns the expected dictionary.
* A malformed JSON input logs a warning and returns `None`.
* A JSON input missing required fields logs a warning and returns `None`.
* A JSON input with incorrect types for the required fields logs a warning and returns `None`.

You do not need to implement batch processing or file I/O in this step — focus solely on validating one file at a time.

---

### **Step 3: Group Valid Files by `session_guid`**

**What it accomplishes:**
Builds a data structure that groups successfully validated files in memory by `session_guid`, using filename as the timestamp key for sorting.

**How to verify:**

* Run the script with sample files that span multiple sessions.
* Log the number of files per session.
* Confirm all valid entries are grouped as expected.
* Add unit tests for grouping logic with mocked file data.

**Detailed Prompt**

You are continuing to build a script that processes session data files. At this point, you have a list of validated session records.

### 🛠️ Task

Implement a function that takes a list of validated session records and groups them by `session_guid`.

Each input record is a dictionary in this form:

```python
{
  "filename": "2025-05-02T12:10:50.644423+0000_2374",
  "session_guid": "abc-123",
  "session_data": [...],
  "environment": "production"
}
```

Your function should:

```python
def group_by_session_guid(records: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]]:
```

* Return a dictionary where:

  * Keys are `session_guid` strings.
  * Values are **lists of records** (each with the full original structure) for that session.
* Maintain insertion order (or sort later based on filename in a future step).

### 🧪 Verification

Add test code that:

* Groups a list of at least 5 fake records with 2 different `session_guid` values.
* Prints the number of sessions and the number of files in each group.
* Confirms that all records are present and grouped correctly.

Do not implement timestamp sorting or merging yet — this step only organizes validated records into buckets by `session_guid`.

---

### **Step 4: Sort Session Entries and Collect Timestamps**

**What it accomplishes:**
Sorts each session’s grouped files by timestamp (from the filename) and prepares the ordered list of timestamps for metadata.

**How to verify:**

* Confirm output order matches timestamp order from filenames.
* Check that `timestamp_list` matches expected values.
* Add tests using mock filenames to confirm sort stability.

---

### **Step 5: Validate and Deduplicate `environment` per Session**

**What it accomplishes:**
Checks that all entries in a session have the same `environment` value, warns if not, and uses the first encountered.

**How to verify:**

* Use test data with both consistent and inconsistent environments.
* Verify warning is logged when values differ.
* Confirm only one `environment` value is retained in metadata.

---

### **Step 6: Merge `session_data` Arrays**

**What it accomplishes:**
For each session, merges all ordered `session_data` arrays into a single rrweb event stream.

**How to verify:**

* Run against test sessions with known event counts.
* Confirm that merged `rrweb_data` matches total event count.
* Add assertions in unit tests for combined arrays.

---

### **Step 7: Save Final Session Objects to Compact JSON**

**What it accomplishes:**
Writes each processed session to a compact JSON file named `<session_guid>.json` in the target output directory.

**How to verify:**

* Confirm output files are created with correct names.
* Check JSON format is compact (e.g., no extra whitespace).
* Verify contents against expected structure with a test case.

---

### **Step 8: Add Summary Logging**

**What it accomplishes:**
At the end of the run, prints/logs a summary of:

* Total files processed
* Files skipped
* Sessions written
* Warnings raised

**How to verify:**

* Review log output after sample run.
* Confirm numbers match expectations.
* Add a small integration test with a few files.

---

### **Step 9: Add CLI Interface (bucket name, output dir, verbosity)**

**What it accomplishes:**
Adds user-facing command-line arguments to set GCS bucket name, output directory, and logging level.

**How to verify:**

* Run the script with different CLI flags.
* Confirm that behavior (paths, verbosity) matches input.
* Add a help message and test with `--help`.
